### This application was designed mainly for it's UI part of the app, as it is very simple and user friendly.
### Up to date, it has no database connected to it so far, so the data inside are static(not stored or fetched from the internet), but it is planned to have a Firebase database linked to it soon.
### Also, the next step in this app will be to switch from Activities to fragments, as it optimizes the app performance.(Note that this app started as a side project to learn more about Activities at that time.)
### If you want to contribute, feel free to do so on the Firebase and Fragments parts.
